# Hello, I'm Gabriel  Arruda

**Ph.D. Student in Economics at UFSC**

I am interested in **time series econometrics**, with applications in macroeconomics and finance. Currently, I focus on deepening my knowledge in economic modeling, utilizing tools that optimize the analysis and forecasting of economic behavior. Iâ€™m currently working on book of [time series](https://github.com/g-arruda/series-temporais).

## Tools

- **R:** Advanced expertise for analyses, econometric modeling, process automation, and web scraping.
- **Python:** Currently learning to expand my data processing and automation capabilities.
- **Julia:** Growing interest to enhance computational model performance.

## Why GitHub?

I use GitHub as a space to **organize my projects** and apply version control with Git, which allows me to continuously track and improve my work. I strongly believe that knowledge should be **free and public**, contributing to the community and helping those in need of resources and references in the field.

## Contribution and Collaboration

- Econometric 
- Macroeconomics
- Finance
- Process automation
